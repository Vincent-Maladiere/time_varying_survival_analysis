# Credit Risk Models

This repository contains a real-world data science project from a fintech startup,
which gracefully accepted to help the data science open source community.
This startup provides credit lines to car dealerships which help them buy new cars on
the second-hand market.

## Context

Each dealer (a.k.a borrower) can ask for multiple loans, within the limit of their
credit lines. From the moment loans are granted and the money transfered on
dealers' accounts, **dealers have 149 days to reimburse**. Failing to reimburse a loan
after the 149 days limit terminates the loan, with the reason **"Maturity reached"**.

Additionally, dealers have to perform audits and checks, to prove the car they bought
is still in the parking lot of their dealership. These audits are scheduled every
30 days, and dealers have 30 days to perform them. If a dealer doesn't submit an audit
before the due date, the audit is said to be overdue. When the audit is overdue for more
than 14 days, the loan is terminated, with the reason **"Audit overdue"**.

Finally, when the dealers indicate that they successfully sold the car linked to their
loan, they only have 5 days to make a reimbursement. Failing to reimburse after 5 days
past the selling of the car also terminates the loan, with the reason
**"Car sold not paid"**.

Therefore, a loan can only be terminated because of maturity reached when its dealer
failed to sell the car (which has been bought with this loan) within the 149 days period.

Note that when a loan is reimbursed in due date (which is the happy scenario),
it is closed but not terminated. When a loan is terminated (which is the unfortunate
scenario), a collection team contacts the dealer and asks for repayment.
Then, a terminated loan may or may not get reimbursed. When it is not reimbursed after
multiple contacts with the collection team, it is considered a default, which can
then trigger legal actions.

## Objectives

Due to the increasing number of defaulting loans, the startup has two different
objectives:

**1. Projecting the total loss due to default**

With an accurate total loss projection, the startup can provision the right amount
to compensate for that loss, using this formula:

$$ \mathrm{Loss} = P(\mathrm{Default}) \times \mathrm{Total_{Exposure}} $$

Where $P(\mathrm{Default})$ represents the average probability of a dealer to default
(which result in the total of its loans to be lost), and $\mathrm{Total_{Exposure}}$
represents the total amount loaned by the startup, at risk.

A dealer can be represented as a list of loans. When they don't have any on-going loans,
their default probability is 0. However, when they have multiple on-going loans, their
default probability corresponds to the highest default probability of their loans.

```python
dealer_proba = max(loans_probas)
```

The startup considers that when a dealer defaults on a loan, they actually defaults
all their loans â€“if they can't reimburse a loan, they likely won't reimburse their other
loans still on-going.

**Estimating default probabilities directly is hard**, because it entails knowing the
actions, successes and failures from the collection team, with features like phone
recording or email exchanges that we don't have.

Instead, we should aim at predicting the **termination probability**, which is free of
any interaction from the collection team. We can write the default probability of each
loan as:

$$ P(\mathrm{Default}) = P(\mathrm{Termination}) \times P(\mathrm{Default} | \mathrm{Termination})$$

Where $P(\mathrm{Default} | \mathrm{Termination})$ represents the probability of
the startup failing to recollect a terminated loan. This can be determined using
simple statistics on past recollections, or later with another ML model.

**2. Flagging the dealers with the higher risk of default**

Predicting loan termination probabilities also helps the startup's customer success
managers (CSMs) to flag dealers with highly risky loans. Using per-prediction feature
importances, the CSMs can then take several actions, like refusing new loans
applications from risky dealers, or assist them in their cashflow management.

In this context, the objective is also to estimate loan termination probabilities.
By taking the max, we estimate the termination probability of dealers, and rank them
on a dashboard. Later, by getting CSMs feedback, we can define a cost matrix to set
multiple thresholds on the termination probabilities. These thresholds correspond
to different labels/buckets in which we place dealers. For instance we can define
high termination probability, medium risk and low risk buckets.

This objective also relies a lot on prediction-level interpretability for the CSMs,
using methods like LIME or SHAP.

## Methodology and survival analysis

Both objectives relies on predicting loan termination probability. Before being
reimbursed or terminated, on loan is on-going. When a loan is on-going, we can't
conclude yet on its future final status.

Therefore, we can tackle this problem with survival analysis, by considering that
on-going loans represent the survival event: the loan hasn't experienced a reimbursement
or termination yet. Since we have multiple events of different nature, we are in a
competing risks setting.

A note on the "maturity reached" termination. When a loan doesn't experience a
reimbursment or a termination before 149 days, it is automatically terminated with
a maturity reached reason. So, **we can argue than maturity reached termination is
actually surviving up to 149 days**. The direct implication is that we only have 2
different events, in addition to the survival event: reimbursment (event 1) and
termination for other reasons that maturity reached (event 2).

The figure below shows the distribution of the termination reason, before collapsing
them into survival, event 1 and event 2.

The duration is defined as the difference between the termination or reimbursment date
and the creation date of the loan. For on-going loans, the duration is the difference
between today and the creation date.

The grey dashed bar represents the 149 day limits. Some old loans were closed past
this threshold because the limit used to be 179 days instead (the black dashed bar).

The issue with old loans is also that some features are not well defined, and they
require a lot of cleaning. We exclude these old loans to make things simpler and limit
biases.

So, by considering on-going loans and maturity reached as survival event (0),
reimbursments as (1) and termination other than maturity reached as (2), our label
distribution is:

## Time varying features

Every day, we have to predict termination probabilities of on-going loans.
This means that every day, we will observe loans of different ages. Some might have been
just created, others might be near the 149 days limit.

For each loan, we want to build features representing their last observed information.
These features can be of multiple kinds:
- Fixed features at the loan level, for instance the amount of the loan.
- Fixed features at the dealer level, for instance the country of the dealership who
  applied for the loan.
- Time varying features at the loan level, for instance the number of audits performed
  for this loan (audits are due every 30 days), or more simply the age of the loan.
- Time varying features at the dealer level, for instance the number of on-going loans
  the dealer has, or more simply the age of the dealer.

A critical aspect of most survival analysis models is that they are not naturally
equiped to deal with time varying features. Most models assume fixed covariates,
available at the introduction of a patient to the study, and constant for its entire
lifetime. Here, the context is quite different: we consider on-going loans as if they
were entering the study everyday, with updated covariates.

### Prediction

Another idea is from lifelines, which proposes [`CoxTimeVaryingFitter`](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Time%20varying%20survival%20regression.html). There approach is slightly different,
because they create observation windows in which they consider whether individuals have
experienced the event or not. Hence, it doesn't seem able to estimate
probabilities for distant time horizon. This approach hasn't been tested yet in this
project.


## Implementation and data engineering

There are three main entry points for the codebase of this project:
- `plot_demo_survival.py`, which is the demo the startup data scientist team gave to
some non-technical stakeholders
- `credit_risk_models/risk_model_survival_analysis/survboost_prediction.py`, which is
the training script used to fit a survival analysis model, manually uploaded on
Azure ML. The startup plans to create a training pipeline, which would run monthly.
- `azureml_pipelines/survboost_prediction_pipeline`, which push a prediction job to
Azure ML. This job will then run daily on the cloud.
